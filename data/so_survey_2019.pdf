2/7/2019  Qualtrics Survey Software

Welcome

Hello world!

Thank you for taking the 2019 Stack Overflow Developer Survey, the
largest and most comprehensive survey of software developers (and
anyone else who codes!) on Earth.

As in previous years, anonymized results of the survey will be made
publicly available under the Open Database License, where anyone can
download and analyze the data. On that note, throughout the survey,
certain answers you and your peers give will be treated as personally
identifiable information, and therefore kept out of the anonymized results
file. We'll call out each of those in the survey with a note saying "This
information will be kept private."

There are six sections in this survey. The 2nd, 3rd, and 4th sections will
appear in a random order.
1. Basic Information
2. Your Education, Work, and Career
3. Technology and Tech Culture
4. Stack Overflow Usage + Community
5. Demographic Information
6. Survey Review
